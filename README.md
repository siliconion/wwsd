#### what would she do? - 2016 Austin Diversity Hackthon submission 
When you are in a tough situation, think: “What would Ripley do?” You know she will be cautious but at the same time courageous. Although it may not seem like it, but she’ll never stop and survive to the end.

Ripley is smart. Be like Ripley.

We need more exercise like this. What Would She Do? The app features strong female fiction characters you can roleplay as, to play out your own or other people’s tough situation.
